Zoohackathon 2017 (New Delhi) project submission by team **Rhino**. Live Demo: https://sidvishnoi.github.io/zoohackathon-2017/ (please view in a mobile, not on desktop)

## About

We attempted to solve problem statement 3 (Your idea!) although we created a game (inspired by problem statement 5).

> details in next commit.

---

The project contains a prototype (mobile-only) website. The major part of project is the game.

Team Members:

- Akshay Yadav
- Rishija Mangla
- Shikha Chauhan
- Sudhanshu Vishnoi

To run, start a local server in the downloaded folder, and view the app in browser. The design, at the time of this submission, is to be viewed comfortably in a mobile device (It'll run in any resolution, but weirdly). S view the website in a mobile or emulate the mobile ([how to emulate mobile device in Google Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode/)).

Python example,

``` bash
~/zoohackathon $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Node.js example: (run `npm i -g live-server`)

``` bash
~/zoohackathon $ live-server
```

## How it works

### Handling reports

User have to physically or electronically(sms, email, video, video) report about illegal marketing or slaughtering of animal to the government officials. Our website waits for the confirmation from the government officials about the report. As soon as the confirmation is received, level is upgraded for the user.

> Note: Identity of user is kept hidden

### Participation in nearby events

Our website collaborates with nearby NGOs. It confirms the participation of user in the event (seminars, lectures, field work, workshop) through the NGOs.
As our website gain popularity with time, more and more NGOs in different areas will collaborate with us.


## Purpose
